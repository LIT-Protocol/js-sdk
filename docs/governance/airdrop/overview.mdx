This first distribution includes a diverse group of participants across several categories:

1. Node Operators who supported testnet deployments and secured early network activity.

2. Builders who shipped applications or tools using Lit infrastructure.

3. Core Integration Partners who integrated Lit into other protocols or tooling.

4. Quest Participants who completed tasks in campaigns such as Ciphernaut’s Path.

5. Discord Contributors who helped moderate, educate, and onboard within the Lit ecosystem.

6. Other Select Groups identified for their impact during Lit’s early growth phase.
