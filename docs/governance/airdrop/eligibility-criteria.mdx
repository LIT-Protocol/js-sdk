title: "Season 1 Eligibility Criteria"
---

The Season 1 Airdrop is designed to reward early contributors who played a meaningful role in bootstrapping the Lit ecosystem ahead of the TGE and v1 Mainnet launch.

This initial distribution will be allocated to a diverse group of node operators who supported testnet deployments and secured early network activity, builders who shipped applications or tools using Lit infrastructure, core integration partners who integrated Lit into other protocols or tooling, quest Participants who completed tasks in campaigns such as Ciphernaut’s Path, Discord Contributors who helped moderate, educate, and onboard within the Lit ecosystem, and other select groups identified for their impact during Lit’s early growth phase.

## Eligibility Criteria

1. **Node Operators**: Airdrop rewards will be distributed to node operators who participated in the Lit Protocol testnet and mainnet beta phases. This includes participants in the Serrano, Cayenne, Manzano, Habanero, and Datil networks. 

2. **Ecosystem Builders and Core Integration Partners**: Ecosystem builders and core integration partners will be eligible to claim tokens in the season 1 airdrop. This includes contributors to core Lit Protocol repositories on GitHub, hackathon participants, grantees, teams and individuals who have released apps and protocols integrating Lit in production and on testnet, and others who have contributed to Lit Protocol along similar lines. 

3. **Quest Participants**: Individuals who participated in any of Lit Protocol's Season 1 Galxe campaigns will be eligible to claim tokens in the airdrop. A minimum of 50 points was required in order to be eligible, implying that you completed tasks that required onchain interactions.

4. **Discord Contributors**: Any contributor who was level 1 or higher who participated in Lit Protocol's Season 1 Discord contribution campaign is eligible to claim tokens in the airdrop. Token allocations were calculated based on each individual's Contributor Level, Badges, and total number of accumulated points.

5. **Genesis Gate NFT Holders**: All holders of Lit Protocol's OG Genesis Gate NFTs were allocated tokens on a fixed basis. 

## Adjustments and Other Notes

### Adjustments
Adjustments were made to the list of eligible airdrop participants to filter out addresses associated with or known to be sybil and / or bot accounts. 

### Rewards and Bonuses
All airdrop recipients can stake their token allocation for additional bonus rewards. For those who participate in the [Lit Staking Contest](/node-ops/staking-contest/logistics) as a node operator OR token delegator will receive a 10% reward bonus. This bonus will be applied directly to your locked token balance after the Staking Contest ends and the v1 Mainnet is live. 

Native [staking reward](/governance/litkey/staking) distribution will also begin after the v1 Mainnet is live. The multiplier used to calculated each individual staker / delegator's token rewards is dependent on the timelock selected, varying from an estimated ~12% to ~100% for those who lock for the minimum (3 months) to the maximum (4 years). 

Please visit the [staking portal](https://staking.litprotocol.com/) to begin your staking journey. Staking will begin after the Lit Protocol TGE.
