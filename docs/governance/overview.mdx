Lit Protocol has established an initial governance system to guide and organize its development and operations. This system exists to manage decision-making related to the core protocol, the infrastructure that supports it, and the broader ecosystem of applications built on top of it.

## Purpose

The purpose of Lit’s initial governance structure is to coordinate and oversee four key areas:

1. Protocol Upgrades: Reviewing, approving, and distributing new software builds to node operators.

2. Resource Allocation and Ecosystem Funding: Distributing capital and other resources to support teams building on top of Lit infrastructure.

3. Node Operations: Setting and managing standards for node operator participation and performance.

4. Metagovernance: Defining and evolving the structures, roles, and processes that govern Lit itself.

By establishing clear decision-making and implementation workflows around these areas, governance ensures that protocol development remains coherent, auditable, and extensible.

## Governance Composition

At launch, governance is managed by the Lit Association, a Swiss non-profit organization dedicated to stewarding the long-term growth of the protocol. In collaboration with the core development company behind Lit, the Association is responsible for maintaining key infrastructure, initiating governance processes, and coordinating core protocol operations.
While the Association will be tasked with helping steward initial participation in governance across the Lit ecosystem, operations will be passed down progressively to a broader set of stakeholders, including ecosystem developers, node operators, researchers, and community members.

## What This Documentation Covers

This governance documentation is divided into three sections:

1. Overview (this page): Context and goals of Lit’s initial governance system.

2. Governance Architecture: Breakdown of the specific components involved in protocol decision-making.

3. Lit Improvement Proposals (LIPs): An introduction to the process for submitting formal proposals to improve the protocol or ecosystem. This section includes details on eligibility, formatting, submission, and approval workflows.
