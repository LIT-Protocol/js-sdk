<Tip>
Lit V1 ("Naga") is currently live on [testnet](https://spark.litprotocol.com/naga-test/). 

If you're a builder looking to deploy your application in production, you can use Lit's V0 Mainnet Beta ("Datil"), already live today ([Link](https://developer.litprotocol.com/)).

# SDK Reference

The Lit JS SDK provides a comprehensive toolkit for integrating Lit Protocol's decentralised authentication and cryptographic capabilities into your applications. This reference documentation covers all the methods, classes, and configuration options available in the SDK.

### 1. Client Setup Layer

- **[Lit Client Setup](/sdk/getting-started/lit-client)**: Initialize and configure your connection to the Lit Protocol network
- **[Auth Manager Setup](/sdk/getting-started/auth-manager)**: Manage authentication state and session persistence across your application
- **[Payment Manager Setup](/sdk/getting-started/payment-manager-setup)**: Deposit funds and delegate payment for network compute resources
- **[Auth Services Setup](/sdk/getting-started/auth-services)**: Configure backend services for minting PKPs and managing OAuth-based sign-in flows

### 2. Authentication Options

- **[PKP Native Authentication](/sdk/auth/pkp-native-auth)**: Authenticate using built-in methods like social login, WebAuthn, or OTP to create and access PKPs
- **[PKP Custom Authentication](/sdk/auth/pkp-custom-auth)**: Implement custom authentication flows using your own identity providers or auth methods
- **[EOA Authentication](/sdk/auth/eoa/eoa-auth)**: Use traditional wallet-based authentication with externally owned accounts

### 3. Auth Context Consumption / Core API Methods

- **[pkpSign](/sdk/auth-context-consumption/pkp-sign)**: Sign transactions and messages using your authenticated PKP wallet
- **[executeJs](/sdk/auth-context-consumption/execute-js)**: Run serverless JavaScript functions with decentralized access control and key management
- **[encryptAndDecrypt](/sdk/auth-context-consumption/encrypt-and-decrypt)**: Encrypt data that can only be decrypted by authorized users or under specific conditions

### 4. PKP Wallet Management

- **[PKP Permissions](/sdk/sdk-reference/lit-client/functions/createLitClient/pkp-permissions)**: Control which users and applications can use your PKP for signing and decryption
- **[PKP Viem Account](/sdk/sdk-reference/lit-client/functions/createLitClient/pkp-viem-account)**: Integrate your PKP with Viem for seamless Ethereum transaction building and signing
- **[PKP View Helpers](/sdk/sdk-reference/lit-client/functions/createLitClient/pkp-view-helpers)**: Query and inspect PKP permissions and metadata from the blockchain

### 5. Network Status & Monitoring

- **[Network Status](/sdk/resources/network-status)**: Check real-time health metrics and availability across Lit Protocol's decentralized network
