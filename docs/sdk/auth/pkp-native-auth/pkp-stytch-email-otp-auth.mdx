title: "Stytch Email OTP"
description: "Stytch Email OTP Authentication uses Stytch's Email OTP service to authenticate users through email verification. This method sends a one-time password (OTP) to your email address, which you then use to verify your identity and mint a PKP."
---

# Prerequisites

<Warning>
Backend Required: This authentication method requires a backend service that handles Stytch Email OTP operations. The auth service already has the implementation in place with the `/stytch/email/send-otp` and `/stytch/email/verify-otp` endpoints, but they are disabled by default. Simply run your auth service at the configured URL to enable Stytch Email OTP functionality.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Lit Auth Server URLs. Please refer to [Auth Services](/sdk/getting-started/auth-services#naga-dev-network) section.
</Note>



<Steps>
  <Step title="Send OTP to Email">
  Enter your email address to receive a one-time password (OTP). The OTP will be sent via Stytch's email service through your backend.

  ```ts
  import { StytchEmailOtpAuthenticator } from "@lit-protocol/auth";

  const { methodId } = await StytchEmailOtpAuthenticator.sendOtp({
    email: "user@example.com",
    authServiceBaseUrl: "https://naga-auth-service.onrender.com"
  });
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify OTP">
  Enter the OTP code sent to your email to verify your identity and generate authentication data.

  ```ts
  import { StytchEmailOtpAuthenticator } from "@lit-protocol/auth";

  const authData = await StytchEmailOtpAuthenticator.authenticate({
    methodId: methodId, // from sendOtp step
    code: "123456", // user-entered OTP code
    authServiceBaseUrl: "https://naga-auth-service.onrender.com"
  });
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup TOTP 2FA (Optional)">
  Add an extra layer of security to your account by setting up TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) 2FA. This will allow you to use authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password for future logins.

  See [TOTP 2FA](/sdk/auth/pkp-native-auth/pkp-stytch-2fa-totp-auth) for more details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get or Mint a PKP">
    You can select an existing PKP associated with your account or mint a new one.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```ts Mint a fresh PKP
      const res = await litClient.authService.mintWithAuth({
        authData: authData,
      });
      ```

      ```ts Using an existing PKP
      const result = await litClient.viewPKPsByAuthData({
        authData: {
          authMethodType: authData.authMethodType,
          authMethodId: authData.authMethodId,
        },
        pagination: {
          limit: 5,
          offset: 0,
        }
      });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

    <Step title="Generate Auth Context">
Use your PKP's public key to create an AuthContext. This method will cache two things:
1. session key pair - a temporary cryptographic key pair generated on the client side that acts as a temporary identity for the client application. It consists of:
    - A public key - shared with the Lit nodes
    - A secret key (private key) - kept securely on the client
2. Delegation AuthSig aka. the inner auth sig - a cryptographic attestation from the Lit Protocol nodes that authorises your session key to act on behalf of your PKP.

```ts

const authContext = await authManager.createPkpAuthContext({
  authData: authData, // <-- Retrieved earlier
  pkpPublicKey: pkpInfo.pubkey,
  authConfig: {
    resources: [
      ["pkp-signing", "*"],
      ["lit-action-execution", "*"],
    ],
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24).toISOString(),
    statement: "",
    domain: window.location.origin,
  },
  litClient: litClient,
});
```
  </Step>
