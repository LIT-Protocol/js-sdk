title: Lit Resources & Abilities
description: "Understand which resource prefixes the Lit network recognises, the abilities each unlocks, and how capability objects scope them."

# Overview

Lit Resources describe **what** you want a delegated capability to touch. Lit Abilities describe **which operation** the holder may perform against that resource. Every delegation or session signature lists both so downstream nodes can enforce the scope before a request executes.

This page summarises the resource prefixes supported by the Lit nodes today, the abilities each exposes, and how wildcard scoping works when building capability objects (e.g., SIWE + ReCap or `createAuthManager` flows).

## Resource catalogue

| Prefix | Shorthand | Description | Resource key format | Supported abilities |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |Ã‡
| `lit-accesscontrolcondition` | `ACC` | Access control condition hashes. Used when decrypting or signing data gated by a condition. | `lit-accesscontrolcondition://<hash>` | `access-control-condition-decryption`, `access-control-condition-signing` |
| `lit-pkp` | `PKP` | Programmable Key Pair NFT token IDs. Grants threshold signing with that PKP. | `lit-pkp://<tokenId>` | `pkp-signing` |
| `lit-litaction` | `LA` | Lit Action IPFS content identifiers. Authorises deterministic JavaScript execution hosted by the network. | `lit-litaction://<cid>` | `lit-action-execution` |
| `lit-paymentdelegation` | `PD` | Payment delegation tokens proving prepaid usage. Lets a delegate authenticate against the payment delegation balance. | `lit-paymentdelegation://<tokenId>` | `lit-payment-delegation` |

<Note>
The Lit nodes reserve an additional prefix, `lit-resolvedauthcontext`, for internal bookkeeping. End-user delegations should only target the four prefixes in the table above.
</Note>

### Wildcards

- Use `prefix://*` to authorise every resource under a prefix (for example, `lit-pkp://*` allows PKP signing with any PKP controlled by the delegator).
- Use `*/*` within a capability object to wildcard every ability for a resource entry. This is rarely necessary; prefer enumerating the specific ability (e.g., `Threshold/Decryption`) whenever possible.

## Ability mapping

Internally, each ability maps into a Recap namespace/action pair:

| Lit ability | Recap namespace / ability | Typical operation |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `access-control-condition-decryption` | `Threshold/Decryption` | Decrypting symmetric keys or JWT payloads behind an access control condition. |
| `access-control-condition-signing` | `Threshold/Signing` | Threshold signing checks required by some access control conditions. |
| `pkp-signing` | `Threshold/Signing` | Using a PKP NFT for message or transaction signing. |
| `lit-action-execution` | `Threshold/Execution` | Running Lit Actions (`executeJs`) hosted on IPFS or supplied inline. |
| `lit-payment-delegation` | `Auth/Auth` | Presenting a payment delegation token to prove prepaid execution quota. |

The Lit SDK builds these mappings automatically when you call helpers such as `generatePkpDelegationAuthSig` or `createAuthManager`. When constructing capability objects manually (for example, via SIWE + ReCap), ensure you choose the namespace/action pair that matches the desired Lit ability.

## Capability enforcement

- Delegations are only honoured if the resource key and ability pair appear in the capability object obtained during authentication.
- The node accepts either an exact resource key or a wildcard entry under the same prefix. If neither exists, the request is rejected before any signing, decryption, or execution occurs.
- Mixing unrelated prefixes or abilities (for example, requesting `lit-action-execution` for a PKP resource) fails validation because the node cross-checks the allowed combinations at verification time.

By scoping to precise resources and short expirations, you can safely hand session materials (like delegation auth signatures) to backend services without granting broader access than intended.
