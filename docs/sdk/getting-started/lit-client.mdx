## Overview

The Lit Client is the core interface for interacting with the Lit Protocol network.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Run the following command to install the SDK:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm i @lit-protocol/lit-client @lit-protocol/networks
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add @lit-protocol/lit-client @lit-protocol/networks
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add @lit-protocol/lit-client @lit-protocol/networks
    ```

    ```bash bun
    bun add @lit-protocol/lit-client @lit-protocol/networks
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Network Configuration & Client Creation">
    Choose the appropriate network based on your development stage and requirements, then create your Lit Client instance.

    Choose the appropriate network based on your development stage and requirements, then create your Lit Client instance.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript dev
import { nagaDev } from "@lit-protocol/networks";
import { createLitClient } from "@lit-protocol/lit-client";

const litClient = await createLitClient({
  network: nagaDev,
});
```

```typescript test
// ❗️ Currently in development. Coming soon...
import { nagaTest } from "@lit-protocol/networks";
import { createLitClient } from "@lit-protocol/lit-client";

const litClient = await createLitClient({
  network: nagaTest,
});
```

```typescript production
// ❗️ Currently in development. Coming soon...
import { nagaProduction } from "@lit-protocol/networks";
import { createLitClient } from "@lit-protocol/lit-client";

const litClient = await createLitClient({
  network: nagaProduction,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Network Comparison

Select the appropriate network environment based on your development stage and requirements. Each network offers different characteristics for testing and production use cases.

| Network        | Type          | Key Persistence  | Payment Required | Use Case               | Status         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| **Dev**        | Centralised   | ❌ Temporary     | ❌ Free          | Development & Testing  | ✅ Available   |
| **Test**       | Decentralised | ⚠️ No guarantees | ✅ Required      | Pre-production Testing | ❌ Coming Soon |
| **Production** | Decentralised | ✅ Persistent    | ✅ Required      | Live Applications      | ❌ Coming Soon |
