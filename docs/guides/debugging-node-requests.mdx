# Overview

When debugging a failing Lit node call, it helps to replay the exact HTTP request without re-running an entire end-to-end flow. The SDK can generate a `curl` command for each request and (optionally) write it to disk keyed by the request correlation id (for example `X-Request-Id` or `x-correlation-id`).

# Enable curl dumps (Node.js only)

Set `LIT_DEBUG_CURL=1` in your environment when running in Node.js (tests, scripts, backends, etc). This is disabled by default and does not write anything in browser builds.

```bash
export LIT_DEBUG_CURL=1
```

Optional: override the output directory (defaults to `./debug`, relative to `process.cwd()`):

```bash
export LIT_DEBUG_CURL_DIR=./debug
```

After you run whatever code triggers requests, you should see files created under `./debug/` named by request id.

# Retrieve a curl command by request id

Once you have the correlation id (for example `X-Request-Id` from node calls, or `x-correlation-id` from Wrapped Keys service calls), you can print the stored curl command and paste it directly into a terminal:

```bash
pnpm debug:curl -- <X-Request-Id>
```

If you only have a prefix/substring, `pnpm debug:curl` will try to match it (and will list matches if more than one file fits).

# Security notes

- The generated curl command includes request headers and body, which may contain signatures or other sensitive data.
- The default `./debug` directory is gitignored in this repo; keep these files local and do not share them.
