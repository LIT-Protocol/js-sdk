## Understanding the Price Table

### Base vs Max Prices

- **Base Price**: The minimum price when network usage is low
- **Max Price**: The maximum price when the network is at full capacity
- **Current Price**: The actual price at this moment, which varies between base and max based on usage

### Product Types

- **PKP Sign**: Signing operations using your Programmable Key Pair
- **Encrypted Sign**: Signing with encrypted keys
- **Lit Action**: Executing serverless JavaScript functions (pricing varies by component)
- **Sign Session Key**: Session-based signing operations

### Lit Action Pricing Components

Lit Actions have multiple pricing components that are charged based on resource usage:

- **Base Amount**: Fixed cost per Lit Action execution
- **Runtime Length**: Cost per second of execution time
- **Memory Usage**: Cost per megabyte of memory used
- **Code Length**: Cost based on the size of your Lit Action code
- **Response Length**: Cost based on the size of the response data
- **Signatures**: Cost per signature generated
- **Broadcasts**: Cost per broadcast operation
- **Contract Calls**: Cost per smart contract call
- **Call Depth**: Cost based on call stack depth
- **Decrypts**: Cost per decryption operation
- **Fetches**: Cost per HTTP fetch request

The total cost of a Lit Action is calculated by summing all applicable components based on your action's actual resource usage.
