This page demonstrates real-world cost estimates for common Lit Action operations. The costs are calculated using current real-time prices from the blockchain and show how different resource usage affects the total cost.

<Note>
These are estimates based on current prices and the specified resource usage. Actual costs may vary slightly based on network conditions and exact resource consumption.

**Pricing Note:** The costs shown here are per request (already multiplied by the number of nodes). On-chain prices are per node, but since your request goes to N nodes and each node charges the product price, the total cost per request is `product_price × number_of_nodes`.

## Understanding the Cost Breakdown

Each example shows a detailed breakdown of costs by component:

- **Base Amount**: Fixed cost per Lit Action execution
- **Runtime Length**: Cost based on execution time (charged per second)
- **Fetches**: Cost per HTTP fetch request
- **Signatures**: Cost per signature generated
- **Decrypts**: Cost per decryption operation

The total cost is the sum of all applicable components based on the operation's resource usage.
