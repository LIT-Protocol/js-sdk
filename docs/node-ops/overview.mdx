<Tip>
$LITKEY and the Staking Contest to Select the Genesis Node Operator Set for the Naga Mainnet are now LIVE.

</Tip>

Lit Protocol is secured and operated by a decentralized network of validator nodes. These nodes are responsible for executing the threshold cryptographic operations that underpin the core functionality of the network, including signing, encryption, decryption, and private compute via Lit Actions.

Each node participates in threshold signature multi-party computation (TSS MPC) protocols and operates inside a confidential compute environment (TEE), ensuring that no single operator can access plaintext key material or violate policy constraints.

Lit node operators are responsible for configuring and maintaining their secure hardware environment which collectively facilitate all network operations (i.e. generating key shares, executing Lit Actions, etc). For an in-depth review, check out the [security docs](/learning-lit/security).

## Mainnet Node Operator Selection: The Staking Contest

A staking and delegation contest will be run to select the genesis validator set for Lit Protocolâ€™s upcoming Naga mainnet. The contest is open to anyone who meets the hardware and staking requirements and expectations which are covered in depth in the next section. 

To whitelist your node, visit https://staking.litprotocol.com/ 

Refer to the next page for details on hardware specs, minimum requirements, and operational guidelines for node operators.
