title: "Acquiring Stake"
---

You'll be able to acquire stake through any combination of the following:

1. Purchasing tokens on supported exchanges
2. Claiming and staking airdrop rewards (if applicable)
3. Securing delegated stake from \$LITKEY token holders

All node operators will need to stake a minimum of 100,000 $LITKEY tokens as a self-stake requirement. Additional tokens can be acquired from $LITKEY token holders via delegation.
