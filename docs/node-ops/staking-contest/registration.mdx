title: "Whitelisting your Node"
---

To whitelist your node, visit the [Lit Protocol staking dashboard](https://staking.litprotocol.com/register). 

1. Login to the dashboard with the **wallet you intend to use for staking on your node**. The wallet you use to login will automatically be linked to your validator profile. Once you register, you won't be able to change it.

2. On the registration page, you will be prompted to fill out important details concerning your validator profile. This includes your name (or the name of your organization), a short bio, and social / website links. Your bio should cover your experience as a node operator and why your node is worthy of delegated stake.

3. After registering, look out for an email from the Lit Protocol team. If you're new to node operations (you didn't participate in Lit Protocol's test or beta networks) the team will reach out to verify your profile and confirm your ability to meet the requirements and expectations and your intention to participate in mainnet node operations.

4. Contest begins: the staking contest will officially commence after the Lit Protocol TGE. Stay on the look out for official communication from the Lit team.
