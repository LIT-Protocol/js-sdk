## Staking Contest: Selecting the Genesis Validator Set for the Lit Protocol Mainnet

The V1 Mainnet launch will commence with a distributed key generation (DKG) process initiated by the top 10 node operators by total stake weight (see sections below) to be determined through a competitive staking and delegation contest.

Stake weight is calculated as a combination of the number of tokens as node operator self-stakes and has delegated to them, as well as a timelock mechanism which is covered in detail in the [\$LITKEY token white paper](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LITKEY-Token-Paper-v1).

The staking contest will be conducted in three phases:

### 1. Whitelist Open 

The whitelist for the staking contest is now open on the [Lit Protocol staking portal](https://staking.litprotocol.com/register). This is where you will register your node for the contest and where token holders will be able to delegate stake to you once the contest begins. For a comprehensive list of requirements, please reference the [node ops documentation](/node-ops/overview).

### 2. Contest Begins 

The staking competition will officially begin after the Lit Protocol TGE. Prospective node operators will be able to build their total stake-weight through multiple channels:

- Purchasing tokens on supported exchanges
- Claiming and staking airdrop rewards (if applicable)
- Securing delegated stake from \$LITKEY token holders

Token holders not interested in participating as node operators can:

- Delegate tokens to support preferred node operators
- Contribute to decentralization by spreading delegation across multiple operators
- Earn staking rewards while contributing to cryptoeconomic security

### 3. Contest Ends and Initial Operators are Selected

After the staking competition ends (timing TBA), the top 10 node operators by total stake-weight will be selected as a part of the initial validator set. Prior to being confirmed, all node operators will need to adhere to the [requirements and expectations](/node-ops/requirements) listed in the applicable documentation.
