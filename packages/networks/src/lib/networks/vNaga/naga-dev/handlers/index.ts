// TODO: Define request creator and response handlers in this folder; export object hash of them here for composition on to naga-dev object
// TODO: Define local types.ts here just for these functions; they will be exposed using `Parameters<>` and `ReturnType<>` on the network object
// Note that if handlers are the same for multiple networks, they can be defined in ../handlers or ../../handlers, and imported / composed on to each network they apply to
