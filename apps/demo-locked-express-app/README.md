# Demo Locked Express App

This example code shows how to lock a server-side app behind an access control condition.

## Getting Started

Setup:

- Edit the `MY_OWN_WALLET_ADDRESS` parameter in `index.ts` to a wallet address that you own.
- Set `PORT` in your shell environment - by deafult port `3001` is used.

Running the app:

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to start the app.
- Go to `http://localhost:3001` (or whichever port you set)
